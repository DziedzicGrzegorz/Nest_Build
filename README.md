## What do you need to install
    nodejs -> I recommend nvs on windows and nvm on macos
    act -> from https://github.com/nektos/act
    docker -> from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

## when you want to commit on .git/hooks/pre-commit run the act command and check if the containers run correctly
